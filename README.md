# A framework for building SoCs with Amaranth

**LambdaSoC is a work in progress. Please keep in mind that some interfaces will undergo breaking changes as they evolve and/or get moved [upstream][amaranth-soc].**

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/lambdaconcept/lambdasoc
cd lambdasoc
git submodule update --init --recursive

pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Quick start

Let's build and run the SoC example at [examples/sram_soc.py][sram_soc]. It is composed of a [Minerva][minerva] CPU, SRAM storage, an UART and a timer.

##### Requirements
* A `riscv64-unknown-elf` GNU toolchain, to build the first-stage bootloader
* A [supported platform][amaranth-boards] with enough resources to fit the SoC

Here, we build the SoC for the `amaranth_boards.arty_a7.ArtyA7Platform`:
```
python examples/sram_soc.py --baudrate=9600 amaranth_boards.arty_a7.ArtyA7Platform
```

The bootloader shell can be accessed from the serial port:
```
flterm --speed=9600 /dev/ttyUSB1
